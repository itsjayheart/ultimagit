<h1>ultimagit</h1>

<h2>what it does</h2>

here is a program

meant to gather in a single terminal command 'ug'

'git add .'

'git status'

'git commit -m 'your comment''

'git log'

'git status'

and

'git push origin master'


<h2>how it works</h2>

you'll need to add in the .bash_profile and.or the .bashrc files the following line of code

alias ug="/path/to/ultimagit.rb" ('/path/to' obviously having to be replaced by the path where you have decided to store it)


then

whenever you're ready to update your project on the Github repository you contribute to

just type 'ug' in your terminal while being in the root folder of your project


<h2>notes</h2>

  this will add all the files you modified since your last commit

if there are updates you do not want to see pushed

you'll need to go the old-fashioned way

or code a new one as long as you make sure to let me know

  in order for this to work

you'll also need to have set up everything right when creating your project folder

good news is you can now do this in less than 10 seconds when it comes to a ruby project
